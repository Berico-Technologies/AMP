* Implementation of CMF (http://github.com/Berico-Technologies/CMF) using AMQP.
* Centrally managed messaging topology (Global Topology).
* Compendium of useful Event and Envelope Processors.
* Toolchain around AMQP/CMF (Maven Archetypes, Monitoring tools, etc.)
* Coming Soon: Event Stream Processor implementation for CMF (Introspex).
* Coming Soon: Policy Interdiction toolset for CMF.
* Coming Soon: Workflow Tracking mechanism for CMF.
* Coming Soon: Common set of service API's built around messaging/CMF.
