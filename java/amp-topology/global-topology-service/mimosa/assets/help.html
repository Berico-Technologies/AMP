				<p>Some messages brokers, RabbitMQ in particular, offer different mechanisms for distributing messages to queues.  Exchanges registered in the Global Topology Service need to have the mechanism described because it greatly affects the topology/strategy for event distribution.  The GTS uses the four supported exchange types provided by RabbitMQ, but could potentially use more if RabbitMQ (or other AMQP broker) is extended.</p>
				<p>The following exchange types, with descriptions, are provided below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Direct</strong> - message routing keys are match exactly against the binding expressions between the exchange and registered bound queues.</li>
					<li><strong>Topic</strong> - messages are routed to bound queues if the routing key matches the queues wildcard binding expressions.</li>
					<li><strong>Fanout</strong> - routing keys are ignored and messages are sent to every queue bound to the exchange.</li>
					<li><strong>Headers</strong> - routing keys are ignored and messages are sent to queues based on matching keys in the message header.</li>
				</ul>
