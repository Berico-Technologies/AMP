# AMP Archetypes

* `amp-quickstart`: A trivial project setup with the necessary Spring Configuration to connect to the *devexample.com* bus.

The quickest way to get started is to copy and paste the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate  \
  -DarchetypeCatalog=http://nexus.bericotechnologies.com/content/repositories/releases/archetype-catalog.xml
```
